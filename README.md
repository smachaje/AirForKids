As we spend approximately 90% of our time indoors, understanding indoor air quality has never been more important.

On top of indoor air pollution, nearly 1 out of every 15 homes in the U.S. is estimated to have elevated radon levels. Radon is a radioactive gas that comes from the ground and is part of the air we breathe. However, like many air pollutants, long term exposure can cause health issues including lung cancer. Unfortunately, a nationwide survey of radon levels in schools estimated that nearly one in five schools in the US has at least one schoolroom with short-term radon levels above the action level of 4 pCi/L, the level at which the EPA recommends that schools take mitigation action. Radon is still responsible for about 21,000 lung cancer deaths every year in the US, hence our dedication to see awareness raised and safeguarding addressed.

If we can raise awareness about the risks of radon and indoor air pollutants, more and more families can start checking for it. The results in terms of saved lives could be enormous. The fun educational materials in the side bar enable you as a teacher the chance to educate on all forms of air pollution, in a manageable, enjoyable and positive way.
